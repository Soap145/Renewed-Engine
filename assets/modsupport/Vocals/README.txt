you might be confused
btw i made these vocals in fl studio in 2 minutes so u can change them if u want




In the charting menu you can go into it by pressing 7
theres a option in song to enabled Pre-Vocals meaning it will use these as the vocals

you might be thinking why do i need this this is for ppl who dont know how to make bf vocals

oh btw hold notes just dont add them or for bf at least

Hold Notes Support: Not Supported 
if the hold notes support gets changed you can do hold notes
